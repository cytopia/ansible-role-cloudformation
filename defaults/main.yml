# This role ships a custom Ansible Cloudformation module:
# cloudformation_diff.py - https://github.com/cytopia/ansible-modules
# This module generates a text-based diff output between your local
# cloudformation template ready to be deployed and the currently deployed
# templated on AWS Cloudformation.
# Why would I want this?
# The current cloudformation module only list change sets in --check mode,
# which will let you know what *kind* will change (e.g. security groups),
# but not what exactly will change (which security groups and the values of them)
# In order to also be able to view the exact changes that will take place,
# enable the cloudformation_diff module here.

# you use yaml-based cloudformation templates, set it to 'yaml'.
